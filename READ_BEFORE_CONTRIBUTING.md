Hello dear contributor, 
We appreciate the fact that you took from you Time to join us here and contribute to our project. 
Please read those guidelines to achieve maximum effectiveness 

1. Don't push directly in the main Branch (everything goes in the dev)
2. You'll have a complete list of tasks (soon) on the project area on the Repo so you can tackle multiple tasks 
3. Describe the pull request. We won't merge any pull request unless it is well explained and tackles one the problems we're mentioning even in the DEV branch
